# RiskyBank - A Spring Security Example Application
This web application serves as an example for usage of the Spring Security framework.

It is intended to be used in the context of a half-day course.

To illustrate common pitfalls which may occur during developing such an app, technical mistakes as well as poor design choices are deliberately part of this project.

Parts of this project are written in German.
